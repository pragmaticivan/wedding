At the end of a slow-paced and difficult work week, this was my safe place to cool down and spend the night dancing Lindy Hop. Here I met Gabriella, and while things did not start off as smoothly as I would have liked, my persistence paid off and our friendship began.</p><p>It’s hard not to become friends with someone when you both spend time together doing something that you love. Our nights of Lindy Hop were the perfect setting for that. It took several months before Gabriella finally agreed to go out on a date with me. I look back now and know it was worth the wait!</p><p>It’s by a miracle of God that Gabriella went out with me. I say it may be a miracle because she knowingly agreed to date a guy who likes Super Hero movies, didn't play soccer, and at the time, didn't have a car (who needs a car?).</p><p>Since then, things have by no means been “easy”, as things worth having never are, but there has been plenty of learning and growing, and I'm thankful to God that with her, I have found my safe place, and challenges worth overcoming. We are so excited to take this next step in life together, and begin our journey as a married couple!</p><p><del>And that, kids, is how I met your mother,</del><br><span class="author">Ivan Santos</span></p></div><div class="col-sm-6 picture-box"><img src="/images/couple-picture.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></section><section class="proposal"><div class="container"><h2>The Proposal -</h2><p class="proposal-text">June 12th was a special day for me. In Brazil, it’s the day we celebrate valentine's day. I told Gabriella we were going to a double date to celebrate that special day, and invited our good friends Zeno and Carol to join us.</p><p>Life was not meant to be enjoyed alone and there would be no reason not to celebrate this moment with friends. With this in mind, I invited a couple of friends she would like to have around on that special moment. I also asked her family for some help, because I knew I could make the evening even more special with their help.</p><p>If you know me well, you will know that I'm very low-key on planning events, but I really wanted to do something memorable and special for the woman I love.</p><p>After planning all of the details, we all drove home after dinner, where the surprised had been prepared with everyone's help.</p><p>You will never be prepared for a moment like that, so I was shaking. Regardless, I can surely say that declaring my love for her and making sure that I would have her by my side for the rest of my life was one of the best days of my life.</p><p>In the end, everything was just as I had I imagined. With lots of candles, roses, and a handwritten drawing I had prepared a couple of days earlier, we shared our special moment with friends and family.</p><p>She said yes!</p><p class="author">Ivan Santos</p></div></section><section class="the-wedding"><div class="container"><h2>The Wedding -</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4"><img src="/images/howl.jpg" alt="Howl" class="wedding-image"></div><div class="col-sm-4 wedding-info"><ul><li><h3 class="wedding-info-title">The Venue</h3><p><span>Howl</span> 237 Long Beach Blvd. Long Beach, CA 90802</p></li><li><h3 class="wedding-info-title">What to wear</h3><p><span>Keep it classy</span> Dress for a party, cocktail attire.</p></li><li><h3 class="wedding-info-title">Parking</h3><p>Parking can be found across the St. at Great Acres of Books parking lot, for $5.</p></li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-4 schedule-of-events"><h3 class="wedding-info-title">Schedule of Events</h3><ul><li class="clearfix"><div class="event-description"><h4><span class="event-time">4:00pm</span> - The Ceremony</h4><p>Will be held upstairs at Howl (there will be AC!).</p></div></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="event-description"><h4><span class="event-time">5:00pm</span> - Cocktail thour</h4><p>Upstairs at Howl</p></div></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="event-description"><h4><span class="event-time">6:00pm</span> - Food, Toasts, Desserts!</h4><p>Downstairs, in the Howl Courtyard</p></div></li><li class="clearfix"><div class="event-description"><h4><span class="event-time">7:30pm</span> - Dancing and party time!</h4><p>Upstairs at Howl with live swing music from She Sings, She Swings!</p></div></li></ul></div></div></div></section><section class="qa"><div class="container"><div class="qa-box"><h2>Q & A</h2><p>We know you’ve got a few questions on your mind.
